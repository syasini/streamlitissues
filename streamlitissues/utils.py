    🚨 Oops! You've hit the search limit... 🫠

    So here's the deal: this app isn't sponsored (yet), which means every time you smash that search button, 
        it costs me actual money. Like the kind that could get me an overpriced coffee from that place that always misspell my name.
    
    If you REALLY REALLY need to search again, try refreshing the browser to reset the counter. 
        But please, go easy on me—I’ve got kids to feed, a mortgage to pay, and a mountain of 
        bills taller than the kids' laundry pile.
